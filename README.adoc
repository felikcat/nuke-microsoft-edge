TIP: This is intended for https://github.com/felikcat/W11Boost[W11Boost], however you can run `Nuke_Microsoft_Edge.ps1` on its own.

.Removed:
. MSEdge update services.
. MSEdge and its devtools.
. The compatibility assistant profile for MSEdge.
. Shortcuts in various locations pointing to MSEdge.
. All MSEdge's prefetch data.

.What is avoided:
. Removal of the following in `C:\Windows\System32`: `MicrosoftEdgeBCHost`, `MicrosoftEdgeCP`, `MicrosoftEdgeDevTools`, `MicrosoftEdgeSH`.
- Why: My assumption that removing these wouldn't help prevent MSEdge from coming back.
. Removal of `EdgeCore`, `EdgeUpdate`, `EdgeWebView`.
- Why: Avoids breaking apps or programs.
