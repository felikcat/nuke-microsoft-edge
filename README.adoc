TIP: This is intended for https://github.com/felikcat/W11Boost[W11Boost], but fully works on its own.

.Instructions
- Download https://github.com/felikcat/nuke-microsoft-edge/archive/refs/heads/master.zip[Nuke Microsoft Edge].
- Run `Launcher.bat`.
- Reboot after its complete and enjoy.

.Disabled:
. MSEdge update services: `edgeupdate`, `edgeupdatem`, `MicrosoftEdgeElevationService`.

.Removed:
. All file associations for MSEdge, making MSEdge no longer the default browser for anything.
. MSEdge and its devtools.
. The compatibility assistant profile for MSEdge.
. Shortcuts in various locations pointing to MSEdge.
. All MSEdge's prefetch data.

.What is avoided:
. Removal of MSEdge update services.

. Removal of the following in `C:\Windows\System32`: `MicrosoftEdgeBCHost`, `MicrosoftEdgeCP`, `MicrosoftEdgeDevTools`, `MicrosoftEdgeSH`.
- Why: My assumption that removing these wouldn't help prevent MSEdge from coming back.

. Removal of the `EdgeCore`, `EdgeUpdate`, `EdgeWebView` apps.
. Removal of Edge's firewall rules.
- Why: Avoids breaking apps or programs reliant on EdgeWebView.
