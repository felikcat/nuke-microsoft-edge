Removes Microsoft Edge and prevents it from coming back after Windows Updates. You can run `Nuke_Microsoft_Edge.ps1` on its own with no issues, but it's intended for https://github.com/felikcat/W11Boost[W11Boost].

.Disabled:
. Update services.

.Removed:
. Shortcuts in various locations pointing to MSEdge.
. All MSEdge's prefetch data.
. MSEdge and its devtools.
. The compatibility assistant profile for MSEdge.

.What is avoided:
. Removal of the following in `C:\Windows\System32`: `MicrosoftEdgeBCHost`, `MicrosoftEdgeCP`, `MicrosoftEdgeDevTools`, `MicrosoftEdgeSH`.
- Why: My assumption that removing these wouldn't help prevent MSEdge from coming back.
. Removal of `EdgeCore`, `EdgeUpdate`, `EdgeWebView`.
- Why: Avoids breaking apps or programs.
